# Turborepo Monorepo

This repository is a Turborepo-powered monorepo using pnpm workspaces. It is designed to support multiple Next.js applications along with shared packages for UI components, configuration, styling, and CMS integrations.


## Monorepo Background

This monorepo was initially created using the Turborepo starter, which by default provides:
- A web application
- A docs application
- Shared configuration packages (ESLint, TypeScript, etc.)

The structure was later extended and customized:
- Added three new Next.js applications: main, rlc, and edge
- Added a dedicated Storybook application
- Added a shared UI component library
- Configured Tailwind CSS as a shared setup
- Integrated Storyblok as the CMS layer

  Dedicated Storybook application used to develop, test, and document UI components from the ui package.

## Packages

Reusable and shared code lives inside the packages directory.

- ui  
  Shared React component library used across all applications.

- storyblok  
  Centralized Storyblok utilities, and rendering helpers.

- tailwind-config  
  Shared Tailwind CSS configuration consumed by all applications and packages.

- eslint-config
